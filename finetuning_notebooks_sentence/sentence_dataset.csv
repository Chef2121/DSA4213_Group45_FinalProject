"When President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in as president of the United States inside the Capitolâ€™s rotunda, he will do so facing a bust of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on the federal holiday commemorating Kingâ€™s legacy. Itâ€™s a disquieting contrast for some civil rights advocates who wish to fulfill the late reverendâ€™s dream of non-violent social revolution. Events honoring King and advocating for his vision of a just society will occur across the nation as many in the U.S. observe the peaceful transfer of power in the capital. The concurrent events have been met with mixed feelings by civil rights leaders, who broadly reviled Trumpâ€™s rhetoric and stances on race and civil rights during his third presidential campaign. But many leaders, including Kingâ€™s own family, see the juxtaposition as a poignant contrast and a chance to refocus the work of advancing civil rights in a new political era.",centre

Eight years after the first historic Womenâ€™s March at the start of Trumpâ€™s first term, marchers said they were caught off guard by Trumpâ€™s victory and are determined now to show that support remains strong for womenâ€™s access to abortion, for transgender people, for combating climate change and other issues. Jill Parrish of Austin, Texas, said she initially bought a plane ticket to Washington for what she expected to be Democratic Vice President Kamala Harrisâ€™s inauguration. She wound up changing the dates to march in protest ahead of Trumpâ€™s swearing-in instead, saying the world should know that half of U.S. voters didnâ€™t support Trump. â€œMost importantly, Iâ€™m here to demonstrate my fear, about the state of our democracy,â€ Parrish said.

The officials were not authorized to comment and insisted on anonymity to discuss the yet to be publicly announced move. White House National Security Council officials declined to comment on the matter. The determination is likely to be reversed as early as next week after President-elect Donald Trump takes office and incoming Secretary of State-designate Marco Rubio assumes the position of Americaâ€™s top diplomat. Rubio, whose family fled from Cuba in the 1950s before the communist revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, has long been a proponent of sanctions on the communist island. Rubio will appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday for his confirmation hearing and is expected to address his Cuban roots in his testimony. In the final days of Trumpâ€™s first administration, on Jan. 11, 2021, the White House reinstated the designation, which had been reversed during the period of rapprochement between Cuba and the United States during President Barack Obamaâ€™s second term in office. In doing so, the Trump administration cited Cubaâ€™s support for Venezuelaâ€™s leader, Nicolas Maduro, and its refusal to extradite Colombian rebels to Colombia, among other issues, including its continued harboring of wanted Americans.",centre

"President-elect Donald Trumpâ€™s billionaire groupies Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos are all expected to attend his Jan. 20 inauguration and have scored plum seating for the occasion. According to NBC News, the tech leaders will sit together on a raised platform with Trumpâ€™s Cabinet members and other elected officials during the ceremony outside the U.S. Capitol. During Trumpâ€™s 2017 inauguration, the platform included the Obamas, the Bidens, former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and a smattering of Trump family and Cabinet strategists. Out of the three tech titans, technically only Musk would be an official member of Trumpâ€™s Cabinet as the co-head of the proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). However Bezos and Zuckerberg each donated $1 million to Trumpâ€™s inauguration fund, which essentially secured them a seat for the occasion.  Zuckerberg made a shock announcement that he was rolling back content moderation policies that will affect Metaâ€™s Facebook and Instagram platforms. NBC reported that he has also changed his lobbying staff to better align with Republican policy positions. Meta announced on Jan. 2 that Joel Kaplan, a prominent Republican lobbyist, would replace Nick Clegg as its chief global affairs officer and also added Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) CEO Dana White, a longtime Trump ally, to the companyâ€™s board of directors. Bezos has equally positioned himself to be more palatable to Trump, putting the kibosh on a planned endorsement of Kamala Harris by The Washington Post to the outrage of the legacy newspaperâ€™s staff.

Pekoske was originally nominated to the position by Trump in 2017 and was reconfirmed to the role in 2022 during Bidenâ€™s lone term. It was reported that he planned to stay in office until his current five-year term was up, but now that is not to be.

"A sign for voter registration stands in Columbia, S.C., in 2024. President Trump on Monday revoked an executive order by former President Joe Biden that calls for federal agencies to promote voter registration. The move comes after Republican officials ramped up efforts to turn the 2021 order into a partisan flash point ahead of the 2024 election. GOP officials claimed â€” with no substantial evidence â€” that through this order, the Biden administration overstepped its authority and tried to generate more Democratic voters. Federal laws, however, ban federal employees from favoring one political party over another when promoting voter registration. And the now-rescinded order covered longstanding federal agencies' voter registration efforts that are authorized under federal laws â€” including the State and Defense Departments helping eligible military members and other U.S. citizens living abroad vote. Biden's order led to new voter registration guides, mailers, updated websites and programs such as Veteran Affairs facilities in Kentucky and Michigan distributing and helping eligible voters fill out registration forms. It's not clear what immediate impact Trump's decision to revoke the order will have on efforts to promote more sign-ups among eligible voters. Edited by Benjamin Swasey",left
"Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States by Chief Justice John Roberts.  Donald Trump returns to Washington newly empowered.

The Republican party has remade itself in his image. The Supreme Court has granted him sweeping immunity for his official actions. And, unlike last time, he narrowly won the popular vote.

And Trump is prepared to exercise his new power almost immediately. He's pledged to sign an unprecedented wave of executive actions â€“ many of which will be challenged in court.

These actions include one making it U.S. policy to recognize only two biologically distinct sexes â€“ male and female. And his administration would end birthright citizenship â€” a right explicitly protected by the Constitution.

President Donald Trump's executive actions could make fundamental changes to some of the foundations of American government.

"Song for Our Daughter, the title of the British singer-songwriter Laura Marling's 2020 album, was a shrewd prediction. Marling gave birth to a daughter in 2023, and her recently released eighth album, Patterns in Repeat, is a meditation on early motherhood and the transition to a slower, richer stage of life. The album, recorded in Marling's home, is the most raw of her works, occasionally incorporating specific reminders of her domestic life: a muffled conversation between Marling and her partner, the cooing of their baby. With its dreamy, scaled-back production, the album ends up presenting an understated pronatalismâ€”a rare work of contemporary art that portrays motherhood in an almost exclusively positive light without being explicitly right-wing.

"WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Supreme Court on Monday upheld a North Dakota state House district on an American Indian reservation, rejecting a challenge by local Republican officials. The Republicansâ€™ lawsuit had previously been rejected by a three-judge court that found North Dakota lawmakers had good reason to create the district to give Native Americans a better chance to elect their candidate of choice, under the federal Voting Rights Act. The Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation had asked the justices to leave the district in place. In a separate case, a federal appeals court is weighing a lower-court ruling that ordered a new joint North Dakota legislative district for two other tribes that had argued that the redistricting plan adopted by lawmakers in 2021 diluted their voting strength.

"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) â€” A Democrat in Pennsylvaniaâ€™s House of Representatives has died, the House Democratic caucus said Sunday night, leaving the chamber deadlocked at a 101-101 partisan divide. Rep. Matt Gergely, D-Allegheny, died Sunday. He was 45, House Democrats said. Neither House Democrats or Gergelyâ€™s family disclosed a cause, although they said two weeks ago that he had suffered a â€œmedical emergency over the holidays requiring hospitalizationâ€ in the days before the chamber convened its two-year session earlier this month. House Democrats won a one-seat margin in Novemberâ€™s election, the same one-seat margin that Democrats had maintained in the last legislative session. Gergelyâ€™s death means the chamber will be tied at 101-101 until a special election is held to fill the seat in the heavily Democratic Pittsburgh-area district. In the last two-year session, House Democratic majority managed through various vacancies in their ranks, at times bogging down the pace of lawmaking during the two-year legislative session. In their statement Sunday night, House Democrats said a special election to fill Gergelyâ€™s seat will be called by Speaker Joanna McClinton, D-Philadelphia, at a later date. â€œMatt will be desperately missed in Harrisburg and we know his passing is a tremendous loss to his communities in Western Pennsylvania.

"The Department of Homeland Security is allowing certain law enforcement components from the Department of Justice to carry out the ""functions"" of an immigration officer, according to a new memo sent by the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Benjamine Huffeman. Huffeman's memo, obtained by ABC News, said the order grants the agencies the ""same authority already granted to the FBI."" It said that agents can enforce immigration law. The agencies listed in the memo are the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, the US Marshals Service and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The DEA and ATF have had little experience historically in carrying out immigration enforcement. Historically, the US Marshals only get involved when there has been a migrant who has become a fugitive. Earlier this week, it was announced federal immigration authorities will be permitted to target schools and churches after President Donald Trump revoked a directive barring arrests in ""sensitive"" areas. DHS announced Tuesday it would roll back the policy to ""thwart law enforcement in or near so-called sensitive areas."" Schools and houses of worship were once deemed off-limits, as were hospitals, funerals, weddings and public demonstrations, but no longer after the announcement. ""Criminals will no longer be able to hide in Americaâ€™s schools and churches to avoid arrest. The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense,"" Huffeman said Tuesday.",left

Bera stated, â€œThere is no simple solution. I do represent the Sacramento area. Weâ€™ve got a water system that relies on a big snowpack in the Sierra Nevadas that melts off slowly, and then we can move water south, both to our farmers, but also to Los Angeles.

"CNN senior political data reporter Harry Enten said Wednesday on â€œNewsCentralâ€ that Americans â€œhave become considerably more hawkishâ€ on illegal immigration since Donald Trump was first in office. Enten said, â€œYou can really see that there has been a massive shift from when Trump was first getting into office eight years ago. Deport all undocumented immigrants, you go back to 2015, it was 42%. Go to 2016 it was 36%. Look at where we are now. This was taken at the end of last year, 56%. This is 20 points higher than it was just before Trump got in office the first time. So feelings towards immigration in this country, feelings towards undocumented immigrants and deporting all of them have become considerably more hawkish.â€ He continued, â€œAgain, trying to get at the underlying feelings of wanting immigration levels to decrease. This includes legal and illegal immigration. Look at this, last year, 55%. That is the highest level since the 9/11 aftermath.â€ Enten added, â€œThey want less people coming into the country, look at that. thatâ€™s a 14 point rise from 2023. You go back to 2016 when Donald Trump again was running for president the first time, it was 38%. Thatâ€™s a 17 point rise.

"Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said Sunday on CNNâ€™s â€œState of the Unionâ€ that he did not like President Donald Trumpâ€™s pardons and that it might be time for Congress to examine the presidential pardon powers. Host Dana Bash said, â€œPresident Trump pardoned or commuted hundreds of people convicted of assaulting police in the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. Put a lot of lives in danger, including yours.â€ She asked, â€œAre you okay with that?â€ Graham said, â€œNo. Iâ€™ve always said that I think when you pardon people who attack police officers, youâ€™re sending the wrong signal to the public at large. And itâ€™s not what you want to do to protect cops but he has that power. Biden pardoned the guy that shot two FBI agents in South Dakota. The FBI was all upset about that. He pardoned half his family when he said he wouldnâ€™t. President Trump at least said, Iâ€™m going to do this. I donâ€™t like this. I donâ€™t like it on either side. I think the public doesnâ€™t like it either. So if this continues, if this is the norm, there may be an effort to rein in the pardon power of the president as an institution.â€ Follow Pam Key on X @pamkeyNEN",right
"President Donald Trumpâ€™s meeting Friday with residents of the Pacific Palisades who were affected by the Palisades Fire and elected officials was one of the most productive public meetings in memory, producing specific commitments. These bipartisan commitments can be summarized as follows â€” in what might be called the Palisades Fire Compact. L.A. Mayor Karen Bass committed: President Donald Trump committed: Trump placed Ambassador Grenell in charge, for now, of overseeing the implementation of these commitments. He also warned that residents should be allowed to begin building as soon as possible, to avoid losing faith in the idea. Joel B.

"A California ballot initiative proposing that the state become its own country and secede from the United States has been filed and cleared for signature gathering. If the measure makes it onto the November 2028 ballot, it would ask voters: â€œShould California leave the United States and become a free and independent country?â€ local news outlet KCRA3 reported on Friday. The guidelines would require 50 percent of registered voters to participate and a â€œyesâ€ vote from 55 percent of voters, which would indicate â€œa vote of no confidence in the United States of America,â€ according to the report. The measure would further show that the â€œwill of the people of Californiaâ€ is to become a country.  â€œAccording to the initiativeâ€™s language, it would not change Californiaâ€™s current government or relationship with the U.S. However, it would create a commission to report on Californiaâ€™s viability as an independent country,â€ the report states. â€œThe initiative estimates one-time election-related costs, and forming a commission on national sovereignty and independence would cost $10 million. It estimates that operating the commission would take another $2 million in annual state costs.â€ The circulation deadline is July 22, and the initiative requires 546,651 valid signatures.  â€œLegally seceding the country would require a constitutional amendment, which would require the approval of Congress and 38 states,â€ the report notes.

"The Supreme Court cleared the way on Thursday for the enforcement of an anti-money laundering federal law that requires corporate entities to disclose the identities of their real beneficial owners to the Treasury Department. The justices put on hold a nationwide injunction issued on Dec. 3 by a federal judge in Texas who had concluded that Congress had overstepped its powers under the U.S. Constitution in passing the Corporate Transparency Act. The 2021 law was challenged in court by small businesses. The justices acted after the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the injunction to take effect ahead of a Jan. 13 deadline that most companies had faced to submit their initial reports to the Treasury Departmentâ€™s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCEN. Former President Joe Bidenâ€™s administration had asked the Supreme Court to stay the injunction. It said millions of entities had already complied with the reporting requirement before U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzantâ€™s ruling that blocked the lawâ€™s enforcement nationally even though the small businesses did not ask for that result. The injunction was obtained by the National Federation of Independent Business, which along with several small businesses challenged the law through lawyers at the conservative Center for Individual Rights.",centre

Murkowski, of Alaska, said in a lengthy statement that allegations of excessive drinking and aggressive actions toward women, which Hegseth has denied, show that his behaviors â€œstarkly contrastâ€ with what is expected of the U.S. military. She also noted his past statements that women should not fill military combat roles. â€œI remain concerned about the message that confirming Mr. Hegseth sends to women currently serving and those aspiring to join,â€ Murkowski wrote on social media. Murkowski said behavior that Hegseth has acknowledged, â€œincluding infidelity on multiple occasions,â€ shows a lack of judgement. â€œThese behaviors starkly contrast the values and discipline expected of service members,â€ she said. â€œAbove all, I believe that character is the defining trait required of the Secretary of Defense, and must be prioritized without compromise,â€ she said.",centre
"President Donald Trumpâ€™s White House has instructed the U.S. military to release a hold imposed by the Biden administration on the supply of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, a White House source told Reuters on Saturday. The move was widely expected. Then-President Joe Biden put the hold on the delivery of those bombs due to concern over the impact they could have in Israelâ€™s war with Hamas in Gaza. A ceasefire to halt the war was recently agreed. The Biden administrationâ€™s particular concern had been over the use of such large bombs in the city of Rafah, where more than one million Palestinians in Gaza had taken refuge.

"President Donald Trumpâ€™s suggestion that Egypt and Jordan take in Palestinians from the war-ravaged Gaza Strip is likely to be met with a hard â€œnoâ€ from the two U.S. allies and the Palestinians themselves who fear Israel would never allow them to return. Trump floated the idea on Saturday, saying he would urge the leaders of the two Arab countries to take in Gazaâ€™s now largely homeless population, so that â€œwe just clean out that whole thing.â€ He added that resettling Gazaâ€™s population â€œcould be temporary or long term.â€ â€œItâ€™s literally a demolition site right now,â€ Trump said, referring to the vast destruction caused by Israelâ€™s 15-month military campaign against Hamas, now paused by a fragile ceasefire. â€œIâ€™d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations, and build housing in a different location, where they can maybe live in peace for a change,â€ Trump said. There was no immediate comment from Egypt, Jordan, Israel or Palestinian officials. The idea is likely to be welcomed by Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâ€™s far-right governing partners have long advocated what they describe as the voluntary migration of large numbers of Palestinians and the reestablishment of Jewish settlements in Gaza. Human rights groups have already accused Israel of ethnic cleansing, which United Nations experts have defined as a policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove the civilian population of another group from certain areas â€œby violent and terror-inspiring means.â€",centre

"â€œThe Daily Showâ€ correspondent Jordan Klepper teased out a stark reality from a MAGA voter after Donald Trumpâ€™s second inauguration on Monday was shifted inside to escape the cold. â€œDonâ€™t you think itâ€™s kind of the perfect metaphor?â€ Klepper asked the man in footage that was filmed during Trumpâ€™s inauguration celebrations in Washington, D.C., and aired on the Comedy Central program Tuesday. Klepper was referring to Trumpâ€™s loyal base having to stay outside amid frigid temperatures while the president himself took the oath of office surrounded by the ultra-rich including Amazonâ€™s Jeff Bezos, Metaâ€™s Mark Zuckerberg and Trumpâ€™s self-proclaimed â€œfirst buddyâ€ Elon Musk. â€œYeah, I guess so,â€ the man replied to Klepperâ€™s question. Klepper noted: â€œHeâ€™s inside hanging out with the billionaires while all of his supporters are outside in the cold.â€ The Trump voter downplayed it, though, calling members of the MAGA movement a â€œtough crowd.â€ Klepper continued: â€œThey are prepared to be left in the cold?â€ â€œYeah, absolutely,â€ the man agreed.

"Karoline Leavitt, the new White House press secretary, on Tuesday, drew mockery for her breathless praise of Donald Trump on Fox News.

Leavittâ€™s hyperbole came as she teased an imminent announcement from Trump on infrastructure. While Trump was pilloried during his first term for not delivering on his often-touted â€œInfrastructure Week,â€ on Tuesday he did actually announce that billions of dollars from the private sector will be invested in infrastructure to boost the use and development of artificial intelligence. Critics, though, likened Leavittâ€™s rhetoric on Trump to that which is parroted on foreign state media, particularly in North Korea. â€œPropaganda so blatant it would make the dictator of North Korea blush,â€ one commenter wrote.

"BANGKOK â€” Theyâ€™ve waited six years to call themselves a â€œfamily.â€ Pehthai Thanomkhet and Nathnicha Klinthaworn finally did Thursday when Thailandâ€™s law on same-sex marriage came into effect and they got formally married at a mass wedding event in Bangkok. Wearing a tan Thai suit, Thanomkhet, 31, walked into Paragon Hall, an event space in one of the Thai capitalâ€™s biggest malls. There he held hands with Klinthaworn, 39, who wore a golden-white traditional Thai dress as the couple made their union official. â€œI feel it has unlocked everything,â€ said Thanomkhet, a human resources manager who goes by his English name, Kevin.  â€œWe can now use the word â€˜family,â€™â€ he said. The mass wedding was organized by a Thai rights group, Naruemit Pride, with almost 200 couples successfully registering marriages at the daylong event. In groups of 10 at a time, the couples presented their documents to officials sitting at desks who then legally registered them as married. Spread across the hall, arches adorned with colorful balloons and flowers and the slogan â€œLove winsâ€ served as photo backdrops for many of the newlyweds. Like many others getting married Thursday, Thanomkhet and Klinthaworn had called for years for same-sex marriage to be legally recognized in the Southeast Asian nation. ",left
"NEW YORK â€” They call her the â€˜Queen of Rock â€™nâ€™ Rollâ€™ for a reason. The late great Tina Turner, one of the worldâ€™s most popular entertainers who died in 2023 after a long illness in her home in KÃ¼snacht near Zurich, left behind a vast catalog of classics. And now, thereâ€™s a previously unreleased song to enjoy: â€œHot For You Baby,â€ a rowdy â€˜80s rock song marked by Turnerâ€™s husky tone â€” effortlessly cool and cheery at the same time. It is the first previously unreleased song featured on the forthcoming 40th anniversary edition of her career-defining album, â€œPrivate Dancer,â€ out March 21. The record will be available in a number of formats, including a 5 CD/Blu-ray version that includes a few never-before-released tracks, live performances and music videos. â€œHot For You Baby,â€ written by Australian singer John Paul Young and produced by John Carter, was originally meant to be included on the 1984 album. â€œPrivate Dancerâ€ peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, but it produced Turnerâ€™s sole No. 1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100: â€œWhatâ€™s Love Got to Do With It.â€ It is one of many timeless tunes across her body of work: â€œProud Mary,â€ â€œNutbush City Limits,â€ â€œRiver Deep, Mountain High,â€ â€œWe Donâ€™t Need Another Heroâ€ and a cover of Al Greenâ€™s â€œLetâ€™s Stay Togetherâ€ among them.",left
"Evacuation orders and warnings were issued to more than 31,000 people in the vicinity of two new wildfires north of Los Angeles on Wednesday. The Hughes fire near Castaic Lake in northern Los Angeles County began Wednesday morning and now covers more than 10,000 acres or 15 square miles. It was only 10% contained at 1 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET), according to Cal Fire. The Hughes fire was being fed by high winds and dry conditions, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna told reporters, but according to an update from the interagency fire information center it had not destroyed any structures. A new brush fire began late Wednesday in Sepulveda Pass, growing to 40 acres near the densely populated Sherman Oaks neighborhood and UCLA, but its progress was stopped. Los Angeles Fire Department issued an evacuation warning for residents in the area at 11:46 p.m. (2:46 a.m. ET Thursday) but later ended the alert at 2 a.m. In addition to the approximately 31,000 people under mandatory evacuation orders, another around 23,000 were under evacuation warnings, meaning they should be prepared to leave if told to do so. ""The fire remains a difficult fire to contain, although we are getting the upper hand,"" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said at a news briefing for the Hughes Fire earlier Wednesday.",left

"Kia is recalling more than 80,000 of its Niro vehicles over an issue that could prevent their seat belts and airbags from functioning properly, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Frequent adjustments to the front passenger seat may pose a serious safety risk by damaging wiring beneath the seat that controls critical features such as the airbag and seat belts, the automaker said in a report filed to NHTSA. This could prevent airbags from properly deploying during a crash, deploying unexpectedly or not switching off for small passengers, increasing the potential for injury, the report said. The recall affects 80,255 Niro, Niro EV and Niro Plug-in Hybrid vehicles manufactured between Aug. 10, 2022, and Dec. 13, 2024, and equipped with a manual front passenger seat. As of Jan. 10, no crashes, injuries, fatalities or fires have been reported, according to NHTSA. Kia owners will be notified by March if they should bring their vehicle to the nearest dealership for inspection. Dealership staff will check the wiring under the front passenger seat, fix or adjust as needed and add protective covers to prevent damage.",left
"NASHVILLE, Tenn. â€” Tire manufacturer Bridgestone Americas is closing its LaVergne, Tennessee, truck and bus radial tire plant and laying off 700 workers there, the company announced in a news release. Bridgestone said the closure will help the company â€œoptimize its business footprintâ€ and â€œstrengthen its competitiveness.â€ In addition, Bridgestone announced capacity and workforce reductions at its Des Moines, Iowa, agriculture tire plant and additional workforce reductions in U.S. corporate, sales and operations. In Latin America, it plans reductions in workforce and production capacity in Argentina and Brazil. â€œReductions in force are impacting our corporate, sales and operations in the Americas where a realignment of staffing levels is needed in response to the challenging economic environment,â€ company spokesperson Emily Weaver said in an email. â€œOf our nearly 44,000 teammates across North America and Latin America, just under 4% of our teammates are leaving the company as part of the voluntary and involuntary workforce reductions.â€ The LaVergne plant was the first tire-producing facility in North America for the Bridgestone Corporation. The company stopped making tires for cars and light trucks at the plant in 2009, laying off roughly half of the workers at the time. LaVergneâ€™s United Steelworkers master union workers have preferential hiring rights at the companyâ€™s plants in Des Moines; Akron, Ohio; and Russellville, Arkansas, Weaver said.",left

"President Trump tore into his predecessorâ€™s â€œgrossâ€ mishandling of the migrant crisis for allowing violent gang members with â€œtattoos all over their facesâ€ to stream into the country unchecked. In his first sit-down interview of his second term, Trump told Sean Hannity that the chaos created by President Joe Biden left him no option but to prioritize kicking out illegal immigrants and beefing up security at the southern border. â€œPeople pouring in,â€ Trump said of the some 8 million people illegally entering the country during the four years under Biden. â€œSome of whom, I wonâ€™t get into it, but you can look at them and you can say, â€˜Could be trouble,'â€ he said. â€œThere are people coming in with tattoos all over their face â€¦ typically, you know, heâ€™s not going to be head of the local bank,â€ he quipped. Hours after he was sworn in Monday, Trump declared a national emergency at the border with Mexico, declaring, â€œAmericaâ€™s sovereignty is under attack.â€ Trumpâ€™s pushback against illegal entry at the border has taken top priority already in his first week in office. In the days since returning to the White House, Trump has taken several measures against the issue, including nixing the CBP One app and making plans to deploy some 10,000 troops at the US-Mexico border.",right

"Wild footage captured one manâ€™s fiery approach to battling winter weather woes â€” using a flamethrower to defrost some icy streets in Georgia. Jesse Gentes of Newton County says he typically favors his flamethrower to de-ice sections of local streets over the traditional methods of salt and gravel, WSBTV reported. â€œYes, itâ€™s very good. I usually use it for brush removal,â€ Gentes told the outlet as he unleashed the flames Tuesday. Gentes said he decided to take matters into his own hands when cars began to slip on an icy hill in his neighborhood, causing drivers to lose control of their vehicles. â€œWeâ€™ve been watching them get stuck all morning.

"The colder it gets, the faster they fly. Commercial flights bound for Europe have been taking off late from the States but arriving on time or early, thanks to a more powerful jet stream, strengthened by the arctic air mass that settled along the East Coast last week. A Virgin Atlantic flight that left from JFK International Airport this week an hour and 13 minutes after its scheduled take-off time nevertheless arrived at Londonâ€™s Heathrow Airport right when it was supposed to land, reports the Washington Post. The plane was in the air less than 30 minutes before reaching speeds of over 800 mph over the Atlantic. Pilots have been exploiting the augmented jet stream to coast across the Atlantic Ocean at speeds of up to 840 mph â€” which is faster than the speed of sound, the outlet reported. The planes didnâ€™t break the sound barrier because it was the air moving them so quickly, not their engines. The report compared it to someone walking on a moving walkway at an airport â€“ the person is moving faster because of the walkway, not because theyâ€™re walking faster. The jet stream had the reverse effect on westbound flights, according to the report. What do you think? Post a comment. Each winter, the jet stream intensifies. It also grows in strength at night, when the lower atmosphere starts to cool, which happens to be when many flights from the East Coast take off for overnight trips to Europe.",right

"President Donald Trump's nominee for CIA Director John Ratcliffe appears for a Senate Intelligence confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill on Jan. 15, in Washington, D.C. John Ratcliffe, former director of national intelligence during President Trump's first term, has been confirmed by the Senate as his new head of the CIA â€” the first person to have held both jobs. The Senate approved the nomination Thursday on a 74-25 vote. Ratcliffe is one of the few figures Trump tapped to return for his second term. The former conservative Texas congressman had been a strong supporter of Trump in 2019, when Trump said on social media that he wanted Ratcliffe to be the director of national intelligence, the position responsible for overseeing all 18 of the nation's intelligence agencies. The ODNI role is more supervisory, overseeing all 18 of the nation's intelligence services. Unlike the CIA, it does not deal in direct intelligence collection. This means, for instance the CIA collects, and ODNI assembles the intel from the various agencies to put together products like the President's Daily Brief. Many Democrats objected then, saying Ratcliffe lacked experience and that his main qualification was a fierce loyalty to Trump. Democrats raised similar concerns about his commitment to the president over the law this time around. Critics have said Ratcliffe adopted Trump's views on Russia and downplayed potential threats from that country. Ratcliffe has placed greater emphasis on China, a position which is also in line with Trump â€” and is shared by the broader intelligence community.",left
"HD Video Download ""Even paranoids have real enemies,"" said the poet Delmore Schwartz, who was both clinically paranoid and definitely on to something, according to today's guest: Michael Shermer, the founder of Skeptic magazine, Substack superstar, and author of many best-selling books about rationalism, the evolution of morality, and pseudoscience. He quotes Schwartz in his latest book, Conspiracy: Why the Rational Believe the Irrational, to drive home the point that big, world-changing secret plots happen all the time, but there are reliable ways for us to decide whether Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, 9/11 was an inside job, or vaccines cause autism. For the record, Shermer says yes, no, and no on those counts. Reason's Nick Gillespie talks with Shermer about whether conspiracy thinking is on the rise, whether it's coded left or right, how wokeness poisons science, and whether the reelection of Donald Trump means free thought is ascendant.

"In HBO's docuseries Chimp Crazy, the minds behind the COVID-19 pandemic sensation Tiger King turn to another exotic animal. At the heart of the series is Tonia Haddix, the self-described ""Dolly Parton of chimps."" Haddix's bond with her favorite chimpanzee, Tonka, goes beyond the typical relationship between a human and a pet: She treats Tonka like her child, sharing McDonald's Happy Meals and scrolling through Instagram togetherâ€”though through the bars of a cage. The story begins with the break up of the Missouri Primate Foundation, where Haddix served as a volunteer caretaker. When a fellow volunteer exposes the foundation's cruel conditions, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) intervenes, closing it down and relocating the chimps to true sanctuaries. But Tonka is nowhere to be found. Haddix insists Tonka died shortly before the rescue operation. But with no evidence to back up her claim, suspicions grow. What begins as an exposÃ© evolves into a murder mystery: What really happened to Tonka? Could he still be alive, hidden from authorities? As the standoff between Haddix and PETA escalates, Chimp Crazy raises larger ethical and legal questions: Should animals with near-human levels of intelligence be kept in captivity? What role should the government play in regulating the ownership of dangerous animals? What obligation does a documentarian have to intervene in the face of suffering?",centre
"Earlier today, a US federal district judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking implementation of Donald Trump's executive order denying birthright citizenship to children of undocumented immigrants and immigrants in the US on temporary visas: A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's executive order redefining birthright citizenship, calling it ""blatantly unconstitutional"" during the first hearing in a multi-state effort challenging the order. U.S. District Judge John Coughenour repeatedly interrupted a Justice Department lawyer to ask how he could consider the order constitutionalâ€¦.. Coughenour, a Ronald Reagan appointee, grilled the DOJ attorneys, saying the order ""boggles the mind."" ""This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,"" Coughenour told Shumate. The judge said he's been on the bench for more than four decades, and he couldn't remember seeing another case where the action challenged so clearly violated the constitution. This is just the start of what is likely to be a lengthy legal battle, in just one of several cases challenging the order. It also isn't a final ruling on the merits, even in this one case. Nonetheless, Judge Coughenour's negative reaction to the administration's position is  sign the order is likely to face great skepticism in the judiciary, and is likely to ultimately be struck down. It is also significant that this judge is a Reagan appointee. That's an early indication that this issue may not split judges along left-right lines. I previously outlined why the Trump position on birthright citizenship is badly wrong here and here.",centre

"Pennsylvania has a new Republican attorney general, sworn in on Tuesday, Jan. 21, and one of his first tasks is an investigation into voter registration fraud. The stateâ€™s new attorney general, Dave Sunday, has taken over an investigation that spans multiple counties. In Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, officials have been reviewing hundreds of suspicious voter registration forms submitted in October 2024. The initial investigation has raised significant concerns. Of the 1,203 applications reviewed by local detectives, 367 were verified, 383 were flagged for containing fraud and 453 were unverified and suspected to be fraudulent. Download the SAN app today to stay up-to-date with Unbiased. Straight Factsâ„¢. Point phone camera here Among the red flags were false names, non-existent addresses, forged personal information and incorrect Social Security numbers. Lancaster County District Attorney Heather Adams stated the issue spans several counties. She said that is why she handed over the case to the attorney generalâ€™s office. Officials believe the fraudulent voter registration applications were part of an effort to disrupt the election process. They linked the fraud to a large-scale canvassing operation that began in June 2024. Election offices received the registration forms in question in early October 2024. However, local officials immediately flagged the forms. Adams emphasized the importance of the attorney generalâ€™s office taking over, citing their resources and experience in handling complex cases. The district attorneyâ€™s office declined to release further details as the investigation continues. RELATED STORIES",centre
"Iraqâ€™s parliament added controversial amendments to one of the countryâ€™s laws on Tuesday, Jan. 22, which critics say will effectively make child marriage legal. The amendments give Islamic courts more authority over family matters, including marriage, divorce and inheritance. Critics say it undermines Iraqâ€™s 1959 personal status law, which unified family law and established safeguards for women. Download the SAN app today to stay up-to-date with Unbiased. Straight Factsâ„¢. Point phone camera here Right now, the minimum age of marriage in Iraq is 18 in most cases. The changes would let clerics rule on the subject according to their own interpretation of Islamic law. Some denominations interpret such law to allow girls as young as nine years old to be married.

"Minnesota state lawmakers are bringing forward a constitutional amendment that would send surplus tax dollars back to the stateâ€™s residents. If voters approve it, Minnesotans could receive a check every two years. â€œA substantial surplus would be given back. We have to start taking into consideration where this moneyâ€™s coming from,â€ Republican state Rep. Wayne Johnson said. â€œWe saw at the doors people saying we canâ€™t pay our mortgage, we canâ€™t put food on the table.â€ The refunds would kick in when projected revenues are 5% above total projected spending. All rebates would be tax-free. Download the SAN app today to stay up-to-date with Unbiased. Straight Factsâ„¢. Point phone camera here â€œMinnesotans know best on how to spend their dollars. Really our foundation is how do we make Minnesota more affordable,â€ Republican state Rep. Chris Swedzinski said.  It appears the idea was sparked when the budget surplus was projected to be nearly $18 billion. According to research by American Experiment, the state had about three million taxpayers in 2019 which would have put an equally divided refund at almost $6,000 per person. Circumstances have changed, however, and it could be a while before they see any money. The surplus projection for the next two-year budget cycle is only $616 million, not enough to trigger a rebate. The state is also projecting a $5.1 billion budget shortfall for the 2028-2029 budget cycle. RELATED STORIES",centre
"President Donald Trumpâ€™s administration is cracking down on Washington D.C.â€™s favorite pastime: boozing. All public-facing White House legislative affairs staffers have been advised against drinking with members of Congress, Politico reported Wednesday. â€œWe strongly urged everyone in the legislative affairs office and everyone whoâ€™s externally facing to be thoughtful about their alcohol use in public, and specifically with members,â€ one senior official said, according to the publication. â€œWe strongly discouraged drinking with members.â€ They added, â€œIs one drink a fireable offense? Weâ€™ll have to see what happens.â€  The directive marked a departure from the lack of rules under both the Biden administration and Trumpâ€™s first White House term. It is unclear how many staffers will be affected by the guidelines, but a former Trump White House staffer told Politico that they recalled reminders about drinking responsibly after â€œa few occasions where people had too much to drink.â€ However, no formal policy was ever in place during Trumpâ€™s first term. Acknowledging the social culture in the nationâ€™s capital, staffers were still encouraged to socializeâ€”but to do it sober. â€œItâ€™s a free country, but we represent the White House and the president and thatâ€™s best done sober,â€ the official said, according to Politicoâ€™s source.

"Republican congresswoman Lauren Boebert has invited a group of recently pardoned January 6 rioters to the Capitol for a tour. She promised to be the first member of Congress to give a tour to the â€œhostages,â€ as she and President Donald Trump call them, according to The Independent. Boebert, clad in a bright red winter coat outside a Washington D.C. jail where rioters were held, said one of the only things she regrets about Jan. 6 is â€œwhat the media did to lie about the events of that day.â€ She also parroted the debunked claim that two dozen FBI informants present among the protesters on Jan. 6 were undercover agents. Boebert continued by bemoaning the perceived unfairness directed at the recently pardoned rioters, who were still waiting to be released. She complained about the time and â€œpaperworkâ€ required to set the rioters free. She went on to assert that pardoning the Jan. 6 rioters was part of the â€œmandate [President Trump] received overwhelmingly from Americaâ€ as a result of his election win in November. Boebert also said Democrats likely wish they had not pursued Jan. 6-related prosecutions, saying the now regret â€œthat they didnâ€™t just shut upâ€ about the riots. Boebert has been a long-time supporter of the MAGA movement, Trump, and the Jan. 6 rioters. She was an earlier proponent of the widely discredited idea that there was widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.",left
"Fox News mainstay Sean Hannity made sure to kiss the ring on his way out of the Oval Office after scoring an exclusive interview with President Donald Trump on Wednesday. Hannity described his interview with Trump as â€œamazing,â€ according to a White House press pool report. Slathering more praise on the 47th president, Hannity described Trump as â€œdialed in.â€ â€œHe is focused and heâ€™s happy and he has a big agenda,â€ said Hannity, who seemed to reference what they discussed.  Fox News reported that Trumpâ€™s interview with Hannity will mark his first sit-down talk since his swearing-in ceremony. The interview will air at 9 p.m. as a special Hannity report on the network. The president is expected to talk about the dozens of executive orders he has signed in 24 hours since taking office and his â€œbig agendaâ€ for his first 100 days in office with the Republican party in control of the House and the Senate. Special assistant to the president and communications adviser Margo Martin teased Hannity and Trumpâ€™s meeting with photo on X.

"The Trump administration removed Dr. Anthony Fauciâ€™s security detail on Thursday night, the latest former top official to lose protection. â€œYou canâ€™t have it forever,â€ Trump said on Friday. Fauci, who was the nationâ€™s top infectious disease expert and worked alongside Donald Trump during the pandemic, has received several threats against his life. In May 2022, a man pleaded guilty to sending emails to Fauci and other government officials threatening to kill them and their families. Earlier this week, Trump yanked the security detail for John Bolton, his former national security adviser who later became an outspoken critic of the president. When asked by a reporter if he would feel responsible if anything happened to Fauci or Bolton, Trump said no. â€œThey all made a lot of money. They can hire their own security,â€ he said. Bolton was protected by the Secret Service, while Fauci protected by federal marshals. Fauci was later guarded by a private contractor who was paid for by the government. A source told ABC News that Fauci has hired his own security detail that he will pay for himself. The move comes after Trump revoked the security details for his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and former aide Brian Hook. Both men have been threatened by Iran because of their work during Trumpâ€™s first administration.",left
"President Donald Trump fired the highest-ranking woman in the military while at a ball celebrating his role as commander in chief. The Coast Guard commandant, Admiral Linda L. Fagan, was the first female uniformed leader of a branch of the armed forces. Fagan learned she had been fired while waiting to take a photo with Trump at the Commander in Chief Ball on Inauguration Day, The New York Times reported. Among the reasons Fagan was fired was because of an â€œexcessive focus on diversity, equity and inclusion,â€ the Homeland Security Department said in a statement.  The DHS also said Faganâ€™s â€œfailure to address border security threatsâ€ and the Coast Guardâ€™s long-standing recruitment issues were reasons for her termination. Fagan graduated from the Coast Guard Academy in 1985, part of the sixth graduating class that included women. She has served as commandant of the Coast Guard since 2022. Faganâ€™s firing is part of Trumpâ€™s larger shakeup of the military. His nominee for the Department of Defense, Pete Hegseth, previously said that women should not serve in combat roles. Of the 1.3 million active service members in the military, 230,000 are women. Trump also signed an executive order ending DEI initiatives within the federal government on his first day in office.

Itâ€™s a good start, but he canâ€™t just snap his fingers and make the past not happen.â€ Zuckerberg, who traveled to Mar-a-Lago in December, has since been publicly critical of both the Biden administration, and more generally about how society is being â€œemasculated.â€ Those comments came on Joe Roganâ€™s podcast a few weeks ago, around the time that Zuckerberg added Trump pal Dana White to the board of Metaâ€”another move seen as part of Zuckerbergâ€™s plan to align his social media platform with Trumpâ€™s vision.

"Americans â€œlike what theyâ€™re seeingâ€ so far from Donald Trump based on the first approval polls, according to CNN data reporter Harry Enten. Citing a new Reuters/Ipsos poll of U.S. adults undertaken during the first few days of Trumpâ€™s second administration, Enten noted that the president will end his first week in office with one of his highest-ever approval ratings, at 47 percent. That figure represents a net favorability rating of +6. Trump began his first term at -3. â€œThatâ€™s up nine points,â€ Enten added. â€œTo borrow a Donald Trump phrase, this is big league!â€  (Joe Biden, meanwhile, this month ended his presidency with an approval rating matching his lowest ever, at 36 percent, according to CNN.) Trumpâ€™s first days in office have been marked by a consequentialâ€”and controversialâ€”staffing decisions, legislative proposals and, of course, all sorts of other MAGA drama. Among the most extreme developments has been Trumpâ€™s executive order that aims to end birthright citizenship for babies born on U.S. soil to undocumented immigrants and other non-citizens. The order has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge for violating the 14th Amendment. Trump has also previewed plans to deport undocumented immigrants en masse, with raids beginning this week in cities across the country. Trump has drawn fire for his decision to offer a blanket pardon to nearly 1,500 people who faced charges related to storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, even those who assaulted police officers. He has also seemingly renewed his attempts to take over Greenland. ",left
"President Donald Trump suggested hundreds of thousands of Palestinians should leave Gaza in order to â€œjust clean outâ€ the coastal enclave, stating they could be displaced to neighboring Egypt and Jordan â€œtemporarilyâ€ or for the â€œlong term.â€ Aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump told reporters he has encouraged Jordanâ€™s Abdullah II, a US ally, to â€œtake on moreâ€ Palestinian refugees. Trump likened Gaza, ravaged by 15 months of war, to â€œa demolition site,â€ adding, â€œIâ€™d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location where I think they could maybe live in peace for a change.â€ Trumpâ€™s remarks could be seen as breaking with the USâ€™ long-held support for a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine. In an apparent rebuff of Trump, Jordanâ€™s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said Sunday that his countryâ€™s â€œrejection of displacement is fixed and unchangeableâ€ and called a two-state solution â€œthe way to achieve peace.â€ Trump also said he ordered the resumption of shipments of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, which the Biden administration paused over concerns about civilian deaths. Israelâ€™s bombing and offensive in Gaza, which commenced after the October 7 attacks by Hamas, displaced nearly the entire 2.3 million people who live there, killing over 46,000, more than half of them women, children or the elderly.

As I last year when the legacy media hounded then-Sen. J.D. Vance to say Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, there is a fundamental flaw in the question: â€œThe query includes an undefined term â€” â€˜lostâ€™ â€” which holds a different meaning to Trump supporters and to the anti-Trump inquisitors.â€    In other words, it depends on what you mean by â€œlost.â€  â€œIf asked whether Trump â€˜lostâ€™ the 2020 election, meaning that if all legal votes were counted and all illegal counts discarded â€” and the counting was done legally pursuant to controlling election law â€”â€ the answer should be a resounding, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€     Republicans need to make that point, and the confirmation hearings provide a perfect opportunity.

"The question of pardoning the pro-Trump rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, was â€œvery simple,â€ according to Vice President J.D. Vance. Peaceful protesters should qualify, Vance observed on January 12, about a week before he took office, but â€œif you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldnâ€™t be pardoned.â€ Other Republicans concurred. Alabama senator Katie Britt said: â€œI agree with J.D.â€ Attorney generalâ€“designate Pam Bondi told the senators at her confirmation hearing: â€œI will look at every case on a case-by-case basis.â€ But thatâ€™s not what happened yesterday when Donald Trump signed an executive order granting pardons on a wholesale basis to hundreds of people who had pleaded guilty, been convicted, or were still being sought by the FBI in connection with the riot. They include 172 who pleaded guilty when charged with assaults on police.",right
"The single most important issue in polls during the last presidential campaign was inflation. Thus it is ironic that one policy Donald Trump has preached with particular fervor is tariffs, the goal of which is to raise prices. But the greater irony of Trumpâ€™s tariff plans is that Americaâ€™s tariff system is the quintessential example of what he sometimes attacks as the deep state. Tariffs are managed by opaque bureaucracies and manipulated by high-priced lobbyists in order to extract funds from American consumers. And if oneâ€™s goal is to pare back the powers of the modern administrative state, abolishing the tariff system would be a good place to start.",right
"Over the course of his campaign, now-President Donald Trump said he would end taxes on tips. He promised to build â€œfreedom citiesâ€ complete with flying cars. And, in an attempt to secure the endorsement of the Libertarian Party, he promised at their convention that he would commute the life sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the infamous founder of the online drug market Silk Road. â€œIf you vote for me, on Day One, I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht,â€ Trump said. â€œWeâ€™re going to get him home.â€

Today he made good on that promise, granting Ulbricht a full and unconditional pardon.

Libertarians may be celebrating, but this was a grave misstep. It undermines the law-and-order, return-to-sanity platform that brought Trump back to the White House.",right
"Yesterday, we saw the second inauguration of Donald Trump. Unsurprisingly, he did it his way. He danced onstage with the Village People the night before he took the oath of office.

"There is banana-scented vape smoke in the air. A girl in a hot pink MAGA hat is taking a selfie, the glow of a ring light illuminating her puckered face. Upstairs, a blonde in a fur coat is leaning over a glass railing, surveying the plebeians belowâ€”those with enough connections to land an invite to TikTokâ€™s exclusive inauguration party but not to make it into the VIP section, where influencers, many of whom have millions of followers, mingled with members of Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign staff Sunday night. This could easily have been a funeral to mourn the loss of their beloved TikTok. The Chinese-owned social media platform went dark on Saturday just hours after the Supreme Court ruled that it either had to be sold or banned to protect national security. But, on Sunday morning, Trump announced his intent to sign an executive order delaying the ban on the app by 90 days. By 5:30 p.m., the 47th president declared â€œTikTok is backâ€â€”and the platform flickered back to life. Now, at a nightclub just five blocks from the White House, hundreds are celebrating the resurrection of the app at the TikTok-sponsored Power 30 Awards. Throughout the venue, influencers are posing in front of walls emblazoned with the hashtag #SaveTikTok. A girl with long, white acrylic nails passes out tequila shots to four influencersâ€”including Bryce Hall, a boxer with more than 23 million TikTok followers, and his Argentine model girlfriend Mikaela Lafuente. â€œTo TikTok!â€ someone shouts across the bar, and the quartet clink their tequila shots.",right
"One of the first promises Donald Trump made in his inaugural address was to restore the integrity of a justice system he believes was manipulated against him by his political opponents. â€œThe scales of justice will be rebalanced,â€ he said. â€œThe vicious, violent, and unfair weaponization of the Justice Department of our government will end.â€ When Trump said this on the campaign trail, it sounded like a partisan gripe to the roughly half of the country that loathed him. But on Monday, the man Trump just replaced in the White House unintentionally but undeniably lent credence to his point. With minutes left in his presidency, Joe Biden pardoned five more members of his family. (He had pardoned his son, Hunter, in December.) A few hours earlier, Biden pardoned a slate of some of his successorâ€™s most high-profile opponents, including members and staff of the House January 6 committee as well as longtime government health and science bureaucrat Anthony Fauci and Mark Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. These pardons cover all potential federal crimes dating back to January 1, 2014. In short, Biden issued sweeping acts of preemptive clemency for his allies and familyâ€”before they were even indicted, let alone convicted. The closest any American president had ever come to doing that was Gerald Fordâ€™s pardon of his predecessor, Richard Nixon, after his August 1974 resignation. At the time, Nixon was still a target of the Watergate special counsel.",right
"On January 20, 2009, a few journalists crowded into my apartment in New York, and we had brunch and cocktails, and two or three people smoked cigarettes, and we watched Barack Obama become the 44th president. It felt like a moment of great possibility. There was the obvious historical significanceâ€”Obama being sworn in in the bicentennial year of Abraham Lincolnâ€™s birth and on the same Bible Lincoln had been sworn in on, in 1861. The end of an odyssey. The overcoming of our original sin. But it was alsoâ€”and itâ€™s embarrassing to concede as much nowâ€”a moment of unbelievable cool, which was what Barack Obama was, at least in early 2009. He was from a big city, and he smoked, and heâ€™d done cocaine, and he was black, and his whole demeanor was chill. He was no-drama Obama.",right

"Last February, my book, The End of Race Politics: Arguments for a Colorblind America was published. In it, I argued that color blindnessâ€”the principle that people should be treated without regard to their raceâ€”should guide American public policy. For this, I was called a â€œcharlatanâ€ by Sunny Hostin on The View. I did not foresee that less than a year later Donald Trump would become president again, and that upon taking office, he would end decades of race-based presidential directives and with the stroke of his Sharpie adopt my call for racial color blindness. As Trump put it in his inauguration address: â€œWe will forge a society that is color-blind and merit-based.â€ Trumpâ€™s Executive Order 14171 is titled Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity. It describes how vast swaths of society, including the â€œFederal Government, major corporations, financial institutions, the medical industry, large commercial airlines, law enforcement agencies, and institutions of higher education have adopted and actively use dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called â€˜diversity, equity, and inclusionâ€™ (DEI).â€",right
"On the eve of his inauguration, President Trump wasnâ€™t wasting time with somber reflection or measuring the new drapes. He was, naturally, launching a meme coin called $TRUMP. Within moments of its launch on Friday, its market cap spiked to $14 billionâ€”settling down today at $7.7 billion. The $TRUMP launch was shortly followed by the First Ladyâ€™s own coin, $MELANIA: current market cap around $700 million. The first couple has seen their net worth increase by billions because of this. . . at least on paper. We had questions. A lot of them. Starting with: How is this legal? What is a meme coin? Are people going to lose millions? Is this the digital equivalent of a commemorative inauguration coin or something else?

Trump won the same share of the eligible voters as he did four years ago (32 percent), But Harrisâ€™s share of eligible voters fell by 3.5 points compared to Bidenâ€™s.

"The Hughes Fire has burned more than 9,000 acres Wednesday around the Castaic Lake in Los Angeles County on Wednesday continuing a devastating wave of Southern California wildfires fueled by dry vegetation and Santa Ana winds. Officials reported the brush fire just before 11 a.m. local time on Wednesday and the blaze has since expanded rapidly northwest of Santa Clarita and downtown Los Angeles.

"Critical fire weather conditions continued for areas of Southern California on Wednesday, continuing weeks of wildfires that have wreaked havoc. Red flag warnings were in effect until Thursday night for parts of Los Angeles, Ventura and San Diego counties because of low humidity and an expected uptick in Santa Ana winds, according to the National Weather Service.  On Wednesday a new, fast-growing brush fire forced evacuation orders in the Castaic community in Los Angeles County. Called the Hughes Fire, it has grown to more than 5,000 acres. While respite might come in the form of rain over the weekend, there are concerns of â€œtoxic runoffâ€ from the toxic ash and debris left behind by the devastating wildfires.  As firefighters have been able to gain a foothold on many of the burning wildfires across Southern California, not all have been fully contained.

The first joint addresses to Congress by newly sworn-in presidents are not technically called ""State of the Union"" speeches, but they're delivered under the same circumstances. In his invitation, Johnson told Trump he looks forward to hearing him share his ""America First vision for our legislative future.""
